# Path Fix Summary - October 7, 2025

## Issue Fixed

Training data and models were being saved to inconsistent locations depending on where the script was run from.

## Changes Made

### 1. Training Service (`src/services/training_service.py`)

**Problem**: Training images were saved relative to current working directory, causing them to go to wrong location.

**Solution**:

- Added absolute path conversion for `dataset_path`
- Added informative print statement showing where data is being saved

```python
# Convert to absolute path to ensure it's saved in the correct location
if not os.path.isabs(dataset_path):
    dataset_path = os.path.abspath(dataset_path)

print(f"📂 Dataset directory: {dataset_path}")
```

**Result**: Training images now always save to `FaceRecognition/FaceRecognition/dataset/[person_name]/`

### 2. Storage Service (`src/services/storage_service.py`)

**Problem**: Model files were saved relative to current working directory.

**Solution**:

- Added absolute path conversion for `model_path` in both `save_model()` and `load_model()`
- Updated FAISS index to use the same directory as the model file
- Added informative print statements showing exact save/load locations

```python
# In save_model()
if not os.path.isabs(model_path):
    model_path = os.path.abspath(model_path)
print(f"💾 Saving model to: {model_path}")

# In load_model()
if not os.path.isabs(model_path):
    model_path = os.path.abspath(model_path)
print(f"📁 Loading model from: {model_path}")
```

**Result**: Models now always save to `FaceRecognition/FaceRecognition/models/`

## Directory Structure

```
FaceRecognition/
└── FaceRecognition/
    ├── dataset/          ← Training images saved here
    │   ├── mahinda/
    │   ├── Ronaldo/
    │   └── yasiru/
    ├── models/           ← Model files saved here
    │   ├── enhanced_face_model.pkl
    │   └── enhanced_face_index.faiss
    ├── config/
    ├── src/
    └── main.py
```

## How It Works

1. **main.py** sets working directory to `FaceRecognition/FaceRecognition/` (line 8)
2. **Training Service** converts relative path `"dataset"` → absolute path `"C:\Users\yasiru\Desktop\FaceRecognition\FaceRecognition\dataset"`
3. **Storage Service** converts relative path `"models/..."` → absolute path `"C:\Users\yasiru\Desktop\FaceRecognition\FaceRecognition\models\..."`

## Benefits

✅ Consistent save locations regardless of where script is run from
✅ Clear visibility of where files are being saved (console messages)
✅ No more lost training data or model files
✅ Easier debugging with explicit path printing

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Run `main.py` option 8 to train a new face
2. Check console output for: `📂 Dataset directory: C:\Users\yasiru\Desktop\FaceRecognition\FaceRecognition\dataset`
3. Run option 7 to rebuild model
4. Check console output for: `💾 Saving model to: C:\Users\yasiru\Desktop\FaceRecognition\FaceRecognition\models\enhanced_face_model.pkl`
5. Verify files exist in correct locations
